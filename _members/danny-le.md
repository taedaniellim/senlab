Experiences: I have been working with Dr. Mehmet Sen since June 2022. I have been focused on characterizing the link between fibrinogen mutations and flexibility as an independent undergraduate researcher. I have been regularly writing proposals, grants, and publications with Dr. Sen and am currently working on the expression of fibrinogen fragment X for characterization with the all-encompassing goal of elucidating the intermolecular interactions occurring in fibrinogen to further biochemically and biophysical characterize the protein for future drug development against thrombotic diseases.

Achievements: Provost Undergraduate Research Scholarship and Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship recipient for my current research projects.
