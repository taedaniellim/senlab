My research in Dr. Sen's lab consisted of isolating CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids that can be used in future transfection of DC2.4 and RAW264.7 mouse cell lines. This transfection would then allow for the establishment of novel axB2 knockout cell lines, which can then be used in mice to investigate the relationship between inflammation and cancer.
