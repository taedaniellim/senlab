# UNRAVELING THE MYSTERIES OF PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL REGULATORY MECHANISMS IN PROTEIN FUNCTION

Our research interests lie in the structural and functional basis of receptorâ€“ligand interactions, which are relevant to human health and disease. Much of our studies aim to elucidate the molecular recognition properties governing receptor interactions with a ligand, and subsequent molecular events that couple ligand recognition to receptor activation. Many of the systems we study are related to the interactions between the host cell and environmental cues.

Structural studies are then complemented by functional approaches using molecular biology and protein engineering to dissect structural information, design proteins or peptides with modified specificities and activities, and ultimately contribute to the development of biologics with therapeutic potential.
